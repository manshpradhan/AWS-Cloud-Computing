# Multi-Region Deployment of AWS API Gateway Using Route53 Latency-Based Routing ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to set up a **multi-region deployment** for an AWS API Gateway using **Route53 Latency-Based Routing** to achieve **high availability** and **low latency**. It uses **Terraform** for infrastructure-as-code and **AWS Lambda** to handle requests in two AWS regions.

## Architecture

The architecture includes the following components:

- **Regions**:
  - **us-east-1** (North America)
  - **ap-south-1** (Asia-Pacific)

- **API Gateway**: Serves as the front door for API requests.
- **Route53**: Routes traffic to the region with the lowest latency.
- **AWS Lambda**: Handles API requests in both regions.

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to have the following tools installed and configured:

1. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.
2. **Terraform**: Install Terraform (v1.x or later).

### Step 1: Package your Lambda function

Navigate to the `lambda` folder and package your Lambda function into a zip file:

```bash
cd lambda
zip lambda_function.zip lambda_function.py

## Step 2: Set Up Custom Domain Names and Latency-Based Routing

### 1. Create Custom Domain Names in API Gateway

Follow these steps for both regions (`us-east-1` and `ap-south-1`):

- Navigate to **API Gateway** in the AWS Management Console.
- Select **Custom Domain Names** from the left-hand menu.
- Click **Create** and provide the following:
  - **Domain name**: e.g., `api.example.com`
  - **Certificate**: Use an existing ACM certificate or request one for your domain.
- After creating the custom domain name, **note** the API Gateway domain name (e.g., `abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).

### 2. Map APIs to Custom Domain Names

- In the **Custom Domain Names** section, select the domain you just created.
- Click **Create API Mapping** and:
  - Choose the API you deployed (e.g., `MultiRegionAPI-East`).
  - Specify the **Stage** (e.g., `prod`).
- Repeat this process for the API in `ap-south-1`.

### 3. Set Up Route53 Latency-Based Routing

- Navigate to **Route53** in the AWS Management Console.
- Select your hosted zone (e.g., `example.com`).
- Create an **A Record** for `api.example.com`:
  - **Name**: `api` (or leave blank for the root domain).
  - **Alias**: Yes.
  - **Target**: Choose the API Gateway domain name for `us-east-1`.
  - **Routing Policy**: Latency.
  - **Region**: North America (`us-east-1`).
- Create another **A Record** for `api.example.com`:
  - **Name**: `api` (or leave blank for the root domain).
  - **Alias**: Yes.
  - **Target**: Choose the API Gateway domain name for `ap-south-1`.
  - **Routing Policy**: Latency.
  - **Region**: Asia Pacific (`ap-south-1`).

Additionally, don't forget to create a custom domain name for your API in API Gateway.

## Step 3: Initialize and Deploy with Terraform

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:manshpradhan/AWS-Cloud-Computing.git


## Step 4: Set Up Route53 Latency-Based Routing
- Add latency records in Route53 for the API endpoints in us-east-1 and ap-south-1
