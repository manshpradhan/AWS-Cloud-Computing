Multi-Region Deployment of AWS API Gateway Using Route53 Latency Based Routing ðŸš€

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to set up a multi-region deployment for an AWS API Gateway using Route53 Latency Based Routing to achieve high availability and low latency. It uses Terraform for infrastructure-as-code and AWS Lambda to handle requests in two AWS regions.

Architecture
The architecture includes:

1. Regions:
- us-east-1 (North America)
- ap-south-1 (Asia-Pacific)

2. API Gateway: Acts as the front door for API requests.
3. Route53: Directs traffic to the region with the lowest latency.
4. AWS Lambda: Processes API requests in both regions.

Deployment Instructions
Prerequisites
1. Install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials.
2. Install Terraform (v1.x or later).
3. Package your Lambda function:

cd lambda
zip lambda_function.zip lambda_function.py

Steps

Steps to Configure Custom Domain Names and Latency-Based Routing
1. Create Custom Domain Names in API Gateway
Follow these steps for both regions (us-east-1 and ap-south-1):
- Navigate to API Gateway in the AWS Management Console.
- Select Custom Domain Names from the left-hand menu.
- Click Create and provide:
    Domain name: e.g., api.example.com.
    Certificate: Use an existing ACM certificate or request one for your domain.

After creating the custom domain name:
- Note the API Gateway domain name (e.g., abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com).

2. Map APIs to Custom Domain Names
In the Custom Domain Names section, select the domain you just created.
- Click Create API Mapping and:
- Choose the API you deployed (e.g., MultiRegionAPI-East).
- Specify the Stage (e.g., prod).

Repeat the process for the API in ap-south-1.
3. Set Up Route53 Latency-Based Routing

- Navigate to Route53 in the AWS Management Console.
- Select your hosted zone (e.g., example.com).
- Create an A Record for api.example.com:
- Name: api (or leave blank for the root domain).
- Alias: Yes.
- Target: Choose the API Gateway domain name for us-east-1.
- Routing Policy: Latency.
- Region: North America (us-east-1).

Create another A Record for api.example.com:
- Name: api (or leave blank for the root domain).
- Alias: Yes.
- Target: Choose the API Gateway domain name for ap-south-1.
- Routing Policy: Latency.
- Region: Asia Pacific (ap-south-1).

Also, don't forget to create a custom domain name for your API in API Gateway.

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-region-api-deployment.git
cd multi-region-api-deployment

Initialize Terraform:
terraform init

Deploy the Infrastructure:
terraform apply
Confirm the plan and wait for resources to be created.

Set Up Route53 Latency-Based Routing:

Add latency records in Route53 for the API endpoints in us-east-1 and ap-south-1.

Testing
Use a tool like curl or Postman to test your API:
curl https://<your-route53-domain-name>/lambda
The response should indicate the AWS region handling the request (us-east-1 or ap-south-1).

Cleaning Up
To remove all resources:
terraform destroy

Notes
- Ensure the lambda/lambda_function.zip file is up-to-date before running terraform apply.
- Adjust the Lambda function and Terraform configuration (main.tf) as needed for your use case.
